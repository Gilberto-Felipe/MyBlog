First of all, the purpose of my blog is to keep part of my journey into the realm of software engineering, to assimilate what I have learned by sharing it, and to make myself known through this blog.

My idea is to try to apply the Feymann method, or something similar XD. I want to write in the blog and re-edit what I have written to find a clearer and simpler explanation and a better understanding.

About me, I started in the world of programming at 32 when I decided to study Software Engineering. Before that, I studied philosophy and I was a professor of humanities. With this blog I can do two activities that I love: programming and teaching. I finished my degree at the age of 36 and I consider it a great achievement in my life. 

The first topics will be Programming Fundamentals with Python, and Algorithms and Data Structures. Python because it is a language that makes it easy to learn to program,and because I did the course "Python for every body" that I want to share. On the other hand, algorithms because I want to improve my problem solving.

I'll write about Python and Algorithms in Spanish. This because there is less material in Spanish than in English especially on Algorithms.

Finally, I hope this blog will be useful to someone in the world.

Happy hacking!!
