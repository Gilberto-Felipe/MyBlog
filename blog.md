First of all, the purpose of my blog is to record part of my journey in software engineering, and to share what I have learned.

The first topics will be Programming Fundamentals with Python, and Algorithms and Data Structures.  

I'll write about these two topics in Spanish. This because there is less material in Spanish than in English especially on Algorithms.  

Finally, I hope this blog will be useful to someone in the world.  

Happy hacking!!
