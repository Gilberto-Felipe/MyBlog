First of all, the purpose of my blog is to keep part of my journey into software engineering, to share what I've learned, and to make myself known through this blog.

The first topics will be Programming Fundamentals with Python, and Algorithms and Data Structures.  

I'll write about Python and Algorithms in Spanish. This because there is less material in Spanish than in English especially on Algorithms.  

Finally, I hope this blog will be useful to someone in the world.  

Happy hacking!!
